Description
-----------

Here, give a description of your event's topic, suitable for printing in the PyOhio event booklet. Aim for between 50 and 100 words.  It should help attendees decide whether the event is right for them.


Extended description
--------------------

Here, give more details to help the program committee evaluate your proposal. This will not be published in the program guide. Include anything that will help the committee understand your proposal.  If you are requesting a slot different from the standard 40 + 10 minutes, explain what you require and why.


Outline
-------

Outline the overall structure for your talk. This portion will not be included in the program guide, but will be used by the program committee; a good outline shows that you have begun well-organized preparation. Panel proposals don't need outlines, since they are fundamentally unpredictable.

Bio
---

A brief biography of you and/or the panelists, for publication in the program guide: anything about you that you'd like attendees to know.  Please try to keep it to 50 words or less, or 150 for panels with multiple panelists.

I will sign the recording release agreement (text at http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyOhio/RecordingRelease).
