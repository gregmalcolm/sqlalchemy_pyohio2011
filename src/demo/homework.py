Homework:

Film and Actors are a many-> many relation

Homework:

Films have a category they fall into such as Drama, Comedy, Family...

Homework:

The film table has two references to the language table.

Since we have stores and customers, we next need to add a model for the rental

Next we want to add a model for the inventory table.

We want to also tie this to the rental table and get a list of the most and
least rented films.
